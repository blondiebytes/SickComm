# SickComm
A way to communicate when you are sick

###Inspiration
A couple of months ago I had my wisdom teeth taken out and I had no way of communicating what type of help I needed. I ended up texting or writing in the Notes app, but it became quite a hassle - especially since I wasn't feeling well.

###What it does
To make this easier, I developed SickComm. With this minimalistic app, you can press an icon and have your phone say the corresponding thing you need (water, soup, medicine, blanket, etc). In addition, if you add a caretaker's phone number, you can easily send a pre-made text that corresponds to the icon in order to communicate what you might need when your caretaker is away.

###How I built it
Built natively with Swift and Xcode. Used Twilio API for texting, used AVSpeechSynthesizer to get the phone to say what you want, and implemented the design with AutoLayout.

###Challenges I ran into
AutoLayout - very annoying sometimes.

###Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Submitting this to the App Store!

###What I learned
How to make an iOS application from start to finish
